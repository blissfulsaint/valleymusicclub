# Valley Music Club
Welcome to the official repository for the full-stack development of the Valley Music Club website.

This application is currently in development and is intended to serve as the primary platform for music educators in the Phoenix, Arizona area to participate in Valley Music Club activities, register for festivals, and manage related dues.

An existing website for the organization is available [here](https://valleymusicclub.com/). However, when initially building the site, I had limited experience in web development and technology selection. As the scope of the project expanded, development became increasingly complex, leading to slower progress. Over time, I recognized that a component and hook-based framework like React would better align with the site's long-term needs.

After gaining experience with React, Angular, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS through two internships, I made the decision to transition the Valley Music Club website to a React-based architecture with a serverless backend. This migration aims to improve development efficiency, enhance site performance, and enable a more dynamic user experience. The goal is to eventually retire the old implementation in favor of this new version.

For those interested in the project's progress, updates will be shared periodically.

You can view the latest deployment of the site [here](https://valleymusicclub.vercel.app/)!
