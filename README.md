# Valley Music Club
Welcome to the repository for the full-stack code of the official Valley Music Club web page!

This application is a work in progress, but is intended to eventually become the application through which music educators in the Phoenix, Arizona area can participate in Valley Music Club activities and festivals, as well as pay any related dues. 

There exists already a site for the organization, which you can view [here](https://valleymusicclub.com/). However, when I initially built this site, I understood relatively little about the web development world and, in particular, which tech stack would be best for this project. The scope grew beyond my initial expectations and development slowed as the application became more complex. I eventually came to the realization that a component and hook-based stack such as React may be better for the needs of the site.

After two internships learning React and Angular, and more recently learning about Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I decided to begin transitioning the existing [Valley Music Club](https://valleymusicclub.com/) website from the old tech stack to a React-based architecture with a serverless backend. As stated before, the intent is to eventually use this as the main repository for the site and retire the old one. With this migration will come improved development time to create new features at the request of my client as well as a more dynamic website with faster load times.

If you are interested in the progress of this site, check back periodically for more updates!
